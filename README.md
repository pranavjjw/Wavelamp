# Wavelamp

  Music Reactive lamp with individually addressable pixel rings.


  Functions for different light movements and colors have been pre-programmed. Full 
  list of functions() can be found in the readme file located in the git repository. 
  You can create your own light designs by tweaking functions. Replace the '0' with
  'val' to turn on a particular LED and vice-a-versa.
  
  Adjust the int time variable to set the speed of light motion. By default it is set
  to 40 milliseconds.

  ***********************************************************************************
  Arduino Library for WaveLamp is under-development and will be released soon. This 
  will eliminate the need of including all functions in the code. #Include the 
  library and call the function.
